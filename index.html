            I'm a proud University of Kansas Alum. I've lived in the KC area for the last 6 years
            and can't imagine living anywhere else. I met my wife here. We recently married,
            and we're building our life here surrounded by our families.

            <br>
            After college I started work as a police officer with 
            Overland Park PD, where I am currently assigned as a School Resource Officer at Shawnee
            Mission West High School. I look forward to graduating from the KU Coding Bootcamp, and am
            excited to use my new skills and knowledge toward a new career as a web developer.
